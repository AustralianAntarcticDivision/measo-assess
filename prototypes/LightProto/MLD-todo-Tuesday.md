When you are feeling better, could you please do some preparatory work for me and Rowan to discuss next Tuesday.  I am wanting to see what the quality of data is like for Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), Mixed Layer Depth and light attenuation in the MLD.
 
In the case of PAR, could you please develop the following for each sector for each of the three satellite decades used in Rowan’s paper at two latitudes – 55oS and 65oS, For each latitude:
 
The metric is mean over the decade (and 10, 90% CIs)  of the median over the latitude within the sector of total PAR reaching the water surface over a month.  The plot is then this metric against month of the year with the three decades represented as bars within a month. 
 
In the case of Mixed Layer Depth (MLD), can this be obtained from the MLD products based on ARGO floats.  Again, for each of three decades at the same two latitudes, by month (same plot).  With the metric being the mean over the decade (and 10, 90% CIs)  of (the median over the latitude of (the median over a month from a location on the latitude)). 
 
This would be good for exploring what we can do for these two variables.

PAR

aes decades, monthly (24 months)
-55 and -65
mean, 10%, 90%
