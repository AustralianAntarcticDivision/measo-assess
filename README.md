Q

- navigate outputs, on raijin? sqlite db?  catalogue?


what scenarios? 

ACCESS-ESM

1.5 looking very unlikely

8.5 is a 1/10 deg ocean model

probably CMIP5 fit for purpose in the next year

mark3-lcol - steven phipps model, coupled to carbon cycle (two degree resolution)
- runs in about a week and a half
- no very high resolution stuff 
- doesn't represent sea ice better, Will Hobbs a better connection for that
- most carbon cycle runs have been 2.6 or 3.0 
- for So, go to 1.5 degrees, assume that continues

Tool - ecm val
- take the cmip6 output and produce a whole lot of output
- could incorporate our diagnostic approach ?
