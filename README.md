Andrew Lenton CSIRO, AConstable, SKawaguchi, JMelb-Thomas, Rowan Trebilico, MSumner

Goals

* habitat projections, assessment summary stats, interest especially in extreme differentiation, e.g. west ant ice shelf, also east ant is a big unknown
* krill projections, ocean acidification and application of a krill model
* time slice stuff with Atlantis

Summary

- lcol is likely to be a good start for Atlantis
- 



Q

- navigate outputs, on raijin? sqlite db?  catalogue?


what scenarios? 

ACCESS-ESM

1.5 looking very unlikely

8.5 is a 1/10 deg ocean model

probably CMIP5 fit for purpose in the next year

mark3-lcol - steven phipps model, coupled to carbon cycle (two degree resolution)
- runs in about a week and a half
- no very high resolution stuff 
- doesn't represent sea ice better, Will Hobbs a better connection for that
- most carbon cycle runs have been 2.6 or 3.0 
- for So, go to 1.5 degrees, assume that continues

Tool - ecm val
- take the cmip6 output and produce a whole lot of output
- could incorporate our diagnostic approach ?
- Andrew L also keen to align to standards for output, e.g. COARDs etc. 


There is a summer bias in SO in Access, uses UM, lots of techniques been tried to overcome - the higher res stuff is better
- Andrew L happy to set up a pipeline to output stuff and dump it somewhere
- 5th or 10th percentile approach is prob best, no model is great over the shelf

Andrew Meijers has a published list of best products, and S Corney

Lot of value in overshoot space, compelling arguments for mitigating now
